# Contributing

## How you can help

At the top of each page is a GitHub icon with a dropdown menu which contain options to 'open issue' or 'suggest edit'.
These are probably the quickest way to get involved should you find something that needs attention.

Becoming a bit more involved, you may want to fork the git repository and add your own work. If you are interested in
contributing head on over to the [GitHub source repository](https://www.github.com/orkim/gpg-book) where we have
provided some documentation on helping.

If you are good with code, the build pipeline could always use tweaks. If you enjoy editing or writing copy, it's not
too hard to pickup on the Markup language. Graphic editing is your thing? We could use some images to spruce up the
place.

If you want to pitch in, we're sure to find you a spot. Welcome aboard!
