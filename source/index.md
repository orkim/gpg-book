# The GPG Book Project

## Read the book now!

Head on over to the [introduction](introduction) to access the content of the book!

## What am I looking at?

There are two portions to this project.

- The first part of this project is what you are currently reading now (with content starting at the
[introduction](introduction) page). This is the output (or the 'final product') of The GnuPG Book Project. It's
expected that many people who utilize the information found within this project useful will only ever see this portion
of the project.

- The second part of this project is all the source code and Markup text that is used to produce this website. It is all
freely available in our [GitHub source repository](https://www.github.com/orkim/gpg-book) in its entirety. This is made
available to any developers, editors, graphic designers, or any passerby's which care to make improvements.
