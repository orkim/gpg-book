# The GPG Book Project

## About this project

This project was started to gather some of the more infrequently used commands together.

This resource has been designed to help newcomers (and veteran users alike) out while using GnuPG.

## Current status

Currently several sections have been planned out.  But they are not published at this point. Content should continue to
appear as it is written.

**Note**: Most of the technical issues have been worked through and the book is being built and published as new commits
are pushed.

## What am I looking at?

There are two portions to this project. The first portion is what you are currently reading now. This is the output (or
the 'final product') of The GnuPGP Book Project. It's expected that many people who utilize the information found within
this project useful will only ever see this portion of the project.

However, we also make all the source code and Markup text used to produce this website freely available in our
[github source repository](https://www.github.com/orkim/gpg-book) in its entirety. This second portion of the project
is made available to any developers, editors, graphic designers, or any passerby's which care to make improvements.

## How to navigate

The table of contents is listed on the left side panel and also reproduced at the bottom of each page for sections the
current page you are viewing.

As you browse different sections you will have an outline appear on the right side panel that can be used to quickly
navigate around the page.

Finally, there are helpful forward and backward arrows at the bottom of each screen to help with reading the
documentation in a more linear fashion.

## Contributing

At the top of each page is a GitHub icon with a dropdown menu which contain options to 'open issue' or 'suggest edit'.
These are probably the quickest way to get involved should you find something that needs attention.

Becoming a bit more involved, you may want to fork the git repository and add your own work. If you are interested in
contributing head on over to the [github source repository](https://www.github.com/orkim/gpg-book) where we have
provided some documentation on helping.

If you are good with code, the build pipeline could always use tweaks. If you enjoy editing or writing copy, it's not
too hard to pickup on the Markup language. Graphic editing is your thing? We could use some images to spruce up the
place.

If you want to pitch in, we're sure to find you a spot. Welcome aboard!
