# Introduction

## About this project

This project was started to gather some of the more infrequently used commands together.

This resource has been designed to help newcomers (and veteran users alike) out while using GnuPG.

## Current status

Currently several sections have been planned out. But they are not published at this point. Content should continue to
appear as it is written.

```{note}
Most of the technical issues have been worked through and new builds of the book are being built and published as new
commits are pushed.

## How to navigate

The table of contents is listed on the left side panel. It is also reproduced at the bottom of each page for which
there is a subsection.

As you browse different sections you will have an outline of the page you are currently viewing appear on the right side
panel that can be used to quickly navigate around the page.

Finally, there are helpful forward and backward arrows at the bottom of each screen if you prefer to read in a more
linear fashion.
