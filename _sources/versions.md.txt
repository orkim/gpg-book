# GnuPG Versions

## What versions of GnuPG should you be using?

Always use the latest version of GnuPG. Specifically, use GnuPG version 2.1.x or greater! These versions now include
[sane defaults](https://riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/gpg-best-practices) (see the deprecation notice)
out of the box.

## What if I can only access earlier versions?

Ideally you would update to the latest version available which will include all the improvements and security fixes, but
if for any reason you **must** use an older version there are some resources to help. Most issues with earlier releases
involves less ideal configuration settings.
