## About

The GnuPG Book Project was started out of frustration from continuing to look up the same concepts or command
arguments, often spread across multiple sources, when using GnuPG. There are many actions that only occur very
infrequently (adjusting the expiration date of a key once per year) which makes it difficult to recall the proper way
to accomplish the task.

It is hoped, beyond just documenting these infrequently used commands, that this project will foster a single source of
information regarding best practices, usage patterns, settings to update between GnuPG versions, and concepts can be
explained so that new users may get up to speed quicker.

### Built With

* Generated with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
